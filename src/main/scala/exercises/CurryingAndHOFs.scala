    Exercises:
    - toCurry(f: (Int, Int) => Int) = Int => Int => Int
    - fromCurry(f: (Int => Int => Int)) = (Int, Int) => Int

    - compose(f, g) = x => f(g(x))
    - andThen(f, g) = x => g(f(x))

    - all combinations between two lists (solve using map/flatMap):
      val numers = [1, 3, 4]
      val chars = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    - the same exercise, but using for comprehensions
